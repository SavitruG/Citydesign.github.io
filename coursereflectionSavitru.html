        <h2>1. What are the kinds of problems we see in nature? (Iteration, Recursion, Backtracking)</h2>

        <p><strong>Iteration in Nature</strong></p>
        <p>Iteration refers to repeating a process or sequence of steps until a goal is achieved. In nature, we see iteration in several ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Animal Migration:</strong> Birds, fish, and mammals follow repetitive paths during seasonal migrations, repeating the same steps until they reach their destination.</li>
            <li><strong>Tree Growth:</strong> Trees add one growth ring each year in a repetitive pattern, continuing this process over many years.</li>
            <li><strong>Foraging Behavior:</strong> Ants and bees use repetitive searching patterns to find food, continuing their efforts until they succeed.</li>
            <li><strong>Heartbeat and Breathing:</strong> The processes of heartbeat and breathing repeat continuously to sustain life.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Recursion in Nature</strong></p>
        <p>Recursion involves self-similar structures or behaviors where a process repeats at smaller scales. Examples of recursion in nature include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tree Branching:</strong> The way trees and plants grow with smaller branches resembling the larger ones, following a recursive pattern.</li>
            <li><strong>Snowflakes:</strong> Snowflakes form symmetrical, self-similar patterns at different levels, displaying recursion.</li>
            <li><strong>Food Chains:</strong> In ecosystems, the relationship between predator and prey repeats in a self-similar manner, with smaller organisms playing roles similar to larger ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Spirals in Shells and Galaxies:</strong> Many natural spirals, such as those in nautilus shells or galaxies, exhibit recursive structures.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Backtracking in Nature</strong></p>
        <p>Backtracking is the process of exploring paths and retracing steps when one route fails. Examples in nature include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ant Foraging:</strong> Ants backtrack when they reach a dead-end, retracing their steps to try another path in their search for food.</li>
            <li><strong>Predator Hunting:</strong> Predators like big cats may backtrack during hunting, trying different approaches when an initial strategy fails.</li>
            <li><strong>Bees Searching for Nectar:</strong> Bees backtrack to previous flowers when they don’t find nectar at a new one.</li>
            <li><strong>Maze Navigation by Rats:</strong> Rats exhibit backtracking in mazes, retracing their steps to find an alternative path when they hit a dead-end.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important?</h2>
        <p><strong>Time Efficiency</strong> refers to how quickly an algorithm executes relative to the size of the input. It’s measured by time complexity (e.g., O(n), O(log n)) and is crucial for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Faster execution, improving user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Handling larger datasets without slowing down.</li>
            <li><strong>System Load:</strong> Reducing processor strain.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Space Efficiency</strong> refers to how much memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. It’s measured by space complexity and is important for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Memory Usage:</strong> Running on systems with limited resources (e.g., mobile devices).</li>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Reducing memory usage to save on cloud or server costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Concurrency:</strong> Enabling more tasks to run simultaneously.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why They Matter:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Optimized Resource Use:</strong> Efficient algorithms make better use of time and memory, ensuring smooth performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-World Constraints:</strong> Vital in environments with limited resources (e.g., mobile apps, embedded systems).</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Performance:</strong> Balancing both optimizes overall system performance, making algorithms scalable and practical.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Orders of Growth</h2>
        <p>Here’s a list of common orders of growth with an example for each:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>O(1) - Constant time:</strong> Array element access</li>
            <li><strong>O(log n) - Logarithmic time:</strong> Binary search</li>
            <li><strong>O(n) - Linear time:</strong> Finding maximum in an unsorted array</li>
            <li><strong>O(n log n) - Log-linear time:</strong> MergeSort, QuickSort</li>
            <li><strong>O(n²) - Quadratic time:</strong> BubbleSort, InsertionSort</li>
            <li><strong>O(n³) - Cubic time:</strong> Naive matrix multiplication</li>
            <li><strong>O(2^n) - Exponential time:</strong> Brute force solution for Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)</li>
            <li><strong>O(n!) - Factorial time:</strong> Generating all permutations of a set</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Take Away from Different Design Principles</h2>

        <p><strong>1. Decomposition:</strong> Break complex problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems</p>
        <p><strong>2. Pattern Recognition:</strong> Identify recurring patterns to generalize solutions</p>
        <p><strong>3. Abstraction:</strong> Simplify systems by focusing on essential features.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Pruning:</strong> Eliminate unnecessary parts to save resources.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Lazy Propagation:</strong> Defer updates until necessary.</p>
        <p><strong>6. Sliding Window:</strong> Process overlapping sub-arrays efficiently.</p>
        <p><strong>7. Level Order Traversal:</strong> Explore tree structures level by level.</p>
        <p><strong>8. Hierarchical Data:</strong> Organize data in parent-child relationships.</p>
        <p><strong>9. Edge Relaxation:</strong> Update shortest known distances in graphs.</p>
        <p><strong>10. Balancing and Rotations:</strong> Maintain balance in tree structures.</p>
        <p><strong>11. Kleene Closure:</strong> Find all possible connections or paths.</p>
        <p><strong>12. Pre-Computing:</strong> Store results to speed up queries.</p>
        <p><strong>13. Parental Dominance:</strong> Parent nodes dominate child nodes.</p>
        <p><strong>14. Prefix and Suffix:</strong> Optimize searches with precomputed arrays.</p>
        <p><strong>15. Partitioning:</strong> Divide data for better management.</p>
        <p><strong>16. Bit Manipulations:</strong> Optimize operations using bitwise techniques.</p>
        <p><strong>17. Memoization:</strong> Cache results to avoid redundant computation.</p>
    </section>
        <section>
        <h2>5. Hierarchical Data and Optimization Techniques</h2>
        <p><strong>Hierarchical Data:</strong> Data organized in a tree-like structure where each element (node) is connected to one or more sub-elements (child nodes) through parent-child relationships. It allows efficient representation, traversal, and management of complex relationships.</p>
        <p>Hierarchical data can be effectively represented and navigated using various tree data structures. These structures optimize searching, balancing, and organization of data, with each being an improvement over the previous one:</p>

        <p><strong>Tree:</strong> General structure for hierarchical data like file systems or organization charts. Simple but lacks optimized searching or balancing.</p>
        <p><strong>Binary Search Tree (BST):</strong> Adds ordered structure for efficient searching but can degrade to O(n) if unbalanced.</p>
        <p><strong>AVL Tree:</strong> Improves BST by self-balancing, ensuring O(log n) operations, ideal for frequent insertions and deletions.</p>
        <p><strong>2-3 Tree:</strong> Enhances AVL Trees with a more generalized balancing approach, guaranteeing O(log n) efficiency in all cases.</p>
        <p><strong>Red-Black Tree:</strong> Builds on 2-3 Trees with flexible balancing rules, ensuring O(log n) operations while being easier to implement.</p>
        <p><strong>Heap:</strong> Focuses on priority-based tasks, offering O(1) access to min/max elements and O(log n) insertions, simplifying certain hierarchical operations.</p>
        <p><strong>Trie:</strong> Specializes in prefix-based searches, offering fast lookups for string keys, though it is space-intensive.</p>
