    <h1>Case Study 3: Optimized Electricity and Water Management in Aryavarta</h1>
    
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
        Efficient distribution of electricity and water is important for Aryavarta's development. 
        The goal is to create a system that ensures fair distribution of resources, finds faults quickly, and reduces waste, 
        using simple yet effective algorithms.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Algorithms Used</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Kruskal’s Algorithm</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Design the electricity and water distribution system.</li>
        <li><strong>Use:</strong> Builds a network that connects all areas at the lowest cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Saves money on installation and creates an efficient system.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>
    
    <h3>2. Segment Tree</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Track and update resource usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Use:</strong> Stores the electricity and water use for each area, allowing quick updates and checks.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Helps monitor usage and catch issues like overuse or leaks in real-time.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>
    
    <h3>3. Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Check the distribution system and find weak points.</li>
        <li><strong>Use:</strong> Looks for parts of the system that need repair or improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Makes the system more reliable by ensuring quick repairs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Data Monitoring:</strong> Segment trees track how much electricity and water are being used. This helps quickly spot issues like leaks or overuse.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Network Design:</strong> Kruskal’s algorithm builds the distribution system, connecting all sectors in a cost-effective way.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Checking the Network:</strong> BFS is used to check the system and find parts that need fixing.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Expected Results</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fair Distribution:</strong> Resources are delivered to all sectors fairly, reducing inequality.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower Costs:</strong> The system design saves money on installation and operation.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Reliability:</strong> Quick fault detection reduces downtime and keeps services running smoothly.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Link to SDG Goal 11</h2>
    <p>This case study helps meet SDG Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Efficient Resource Use:</strong> Segment trees help track resources, reducing waste.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong Infrastructure:</strong> BFS helps find and fix problems quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Fair Access:</strong> Kruskal’s algorithm ensures the system reaches all areas equally.</li>
    </ul>
