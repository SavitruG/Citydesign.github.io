    <h1>Case Study 1: Metro Public Transportation in Aryavarta</h1>
    <p>
        Aryavarta is a growing city. Traffic is becoming a big problem because there are too many vehicles on the road. 
        A metro system is being planned to connect important areas like Central Square, Tech Park, City Mall, Education Hub, Industrial Zone, and Residential Area. 
        This will help people travel faster and reduce traffic on the roads.
    </p>

    <h2>Why These Places Were Chosen</h2>
    <p>
        The metro system focuses on places that are important for daily life:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Central Square:</b> The main area for city events and public services.</li>
            <li><b>Tech Park:</b> Where many people work in IT companies.</li>
            <li><b>City Mall:</b> A popular shopping and entertainment spot.</li>
            <li><b>Education Hub:</b> Schools and colleges are located here.</li>
            <li><b>Industrial Zone:</b> Where factories and businesses are based.</li>
            <li><b>Residential Area:</b> Where most people live.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Metro Map Data</h2>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Station</th>
                <th>Connections</th>
                <th>Distance (km)</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Central Square</b></td>
                <td>Tech Park, City Mall</td>
                <td>5, 8</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Tech Park</td>
                <td>Central Square, Education Hub</td>
                <td>5, 7</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>City Mall</td>
                <td>Central Square, Industrial Zone</td>
                <td>8, 10</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Education Hub</td>
                <td>Tech Park, Residential Area</td>
                <td>7, 6</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Industrial Zone</td>
                <td>City Mall, Residential Area</td>
                <td>10, 9</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Residential Area</td>
                <td>Education Hub, Industrial Zone</td>
                <td>6, 9</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Algorithms Used</h2>

    <h3>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h3>
    <p>
        This algorithm helps us find the shortest path between two stations. For example, if someone wants to travel from 
        Central Square to Residential Area, the algorithm finds the route:
        <i>Central Square &rarr; Tech Park &rarr; Education Hub &rarr; Residential Area</i>, which is <b>18 km</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        How it works:
        <ul>
            <li>It starts at the first station (e.g., Central Square).</li>
            <li>It looks at all the connected stations and picks the closest one (shortest distance).</li>
            <li>It repeats this for every station until the destination is reached.</li>
        </ul>
        This helps create routes that save time for passengers.

    <h3>Kruskal's Algorithm</h3>
    <p>
        Kruskal’s Algorithm is used to design the metro network with the lowest cost. It connects the stations 
        using the shortest routes without creating loops. For Aryavarta, the first metro lines were:
        <i>Central Square &rarr; Tech Park &rarr; Education Hub &rarr; Residential Area &rarr; Industrial Zone &rarr; City Mall</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This method ensures all stations are connected while keeping construction costs low.

    <h3>Bellman-Ford Algorithm</h3>
    <p>
        Bellman-Ford Algorithm is used when there might be delays or issues on some routes. It finds the shortest path 
        between stations while considering any extra travel time (like delays between City Mall and Industrial Zone).
        It ensures the metro system still works efficiently, even with these problems.

    <h2>Benefits of the Metro System</h2>
    <p>
        The metro system will:
        <ul>
            <li>Make travel faster for everyone.</li>
            <li>Reduce traffic on the roads and cut pollution.</li>
            <li>Connect important places like homes, offices, and schools.</li>
            <li>Help the city grow in a smart and sustainable way.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Mapping to SDG Goals</h2>
    <p>
        This metro system directly supports the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. Here’s how:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Goal 11.2:</b> Provide safe, affordable, and sustainable transport systems for all. The metro ensures everyone, including people with low incomes, can travel easily.</li>
            <li><b>Goal 11.6:</b> Reduce the environmental impact of cities. The metro reduces air pollution by lowering the number of cars on the road.</li>
            <li><b>Goal 11.A:</b> Link urban and rural areas. By connecting key locations, the metro promotes balanced growth and easier access to jobs and education.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Average travel distance: <b>8.2 km</b>.</li>
        <li>Key station: <b>Central Square</b>, as it connects to all other areas.</li>
        <li>The metro design is simple, efficient, and cost-effective.</li>
    </ul>
