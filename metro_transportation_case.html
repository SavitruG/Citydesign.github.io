    <h1>Case Study 1: Metro Public Transportation in Aryavarta</h1>
    <p>
        Aryavarta is growing rapidly, and traffic congestion is becoming a major issue. A metro system has been proposed to connect key areas: Central Square, Tech Park, City Mall, Education Hub, Industrial Zone, and Residential Area. The goal is to reduce travel time, ease road traffic, and make commuting more sustainable.
    </p>

    <h2>How Locations Were Decided</h2>
    <p>
        Locations were chosen based on their importance in city life:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Central Square:</b> The city's hub for public services and entertainment.</li>
            <li><b>Tech Park:</b> A center for IT companies and employment opportunities.</li>
            <li><b>City Mall:</b> A popular shopping and leisure destination.</li>
            <li><b>Education Hub:</b> An area with schools and universities.</li>
            <li><b>Industrial Zone:</b> Key for manufacturing and trade.</li>
            <li><b>Residential Area:</b> A densely populated neighborhood.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Metro Map Data</h2>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Station</th>
                <th>Connections</th>
                <th>Distance (km)</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Central Square</b></td>
                <td>Tech Park, City Mall</td>
                <td>5, 8</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Tech Park</td>
                <td>Central Square, Education Hub</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Industrial Zone</td>
                <td>City Mall, Residential Area</td>
                <td>10, 9</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Residential Area</td>
                <td>Education Hub, Industrial Zone</td>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Algorithms Used</h2>

    <h3>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h3>
    <p>
        This algorithm finds the shortest path between two stations. For example, to travel from Central Square to Residential Area, Dijkstra's Algorithm calculates the following path:
        <i>Central Square → Tech Park → Education Hub → Residential Area</i>, with a total distance of <b>18 km</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The algorithm works by assigning a tentative distance to each station. It starts from the source (e.g., Central Square) and updates the distances of neighboring stations based on the route cost. Once all neighbors are processed, it moves to the next closest station until the destination is reached.
    </p>

    <h3>Kruskal's Algorithm</h3>
    <p>
        Kruskal's Algorithm was used to design the initial metro network at the lowest cost. The algorithm selects routes (edges) with the smallest distances, ensuring that all stations are connected without forming cycles. For Aryavarta, the network started with:
        <i>Central Square → Tech Park → Education Hub → Residential Area → Industrial Zone → City Mall</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This approach minimizes construction costs while ensuring all key areas are reachable.
    </p>

    <h3>Bellman-Ford Algorithm</h3>
    <p>
        Bellman-Ford handles cases where delays might occur on certain routes. It calculates the shortest path from a source station to all other stations, considering any penalties or discounts. For example, if there’s a delay between City Mall and Industrial Zone, the algorithm finds alternative paths to maintain efficiency.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits of the Metro System</h2>
    <p>
        The proposed metro system addresses several urban issues:
        <ul>
            <li>Reduces road traffic and pollution.</li>
            <li>Offers fast and reliable transportation across the city.</li>
            <li>Connects residential areas to workplaces, malls, and schools.</li>
            <li>Promotes sustainable urban development.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Average travel distance: <b>8.2 km</b>.</li>
        <li>Most important station: <b>Central Square</b>.</li>
        <li>Efficient network design saves time and resources.</li>
    </ul>
