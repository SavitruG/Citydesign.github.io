        <h1>Business Case: Pollution and Waste Management in Factories</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Factory Sustainability: Managing Pollution and Waste</h2>
            <p><strong>Target 12.4:</strong> Achieving the sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, minimizing impacts on human health and the environment. Pollution and waste generated by industries need careful management and reduction. Factories can contribute significantly to sustainable practices by effectively managing and reducing waste through optimized operations and technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Target 9.4:</strong> By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with enhanced resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of cleaner and greener technologies.</p>

            <h2>Pollution and Waste Management Algorithms</h2>
            <h3>1. Pollution Control and Waste Management Optimization</h3>
            <p>Managing waste effectively in a manufacturing environment requires leveraging algorithms to ensure smooth logistics, waste sorting, recycling, and overall waste reduction.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bubble Sort:</strong> In waste management, sorting materials based on size, type, or recyclability is key. Bubble Sort helps quickly sort low-priority waste material before it enters larger recycling systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Quick Sort:</strong> A faster alternative to Bubble Sort, Quick Sort can be used to organize large volumes of recyclable materials efficiently. By reducing the processing time for sorting, factories can enhance their recycling efficiency and keep their waste management processes streamlined.</li>
                <li><strong>Kruskal’s Algorithm:</strong> In pollution management, there’s a need to find the most cost-effective and resource-efficient ways of connecting different waste processing facilities or waste collectors. Kruskal’s Algorithm can help in modeling the best solutions for establishing connections with minimum operational cost, essentially optimizing waste management networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Insertion Sort:</strong> This algorithm helps improve the efficiency of waste processing in factories by managing waste input—sorting batches based on the potential for recycling and material type to avoid mishaps and promote safety during processing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Energy-Efficient Manufacturing: Algorithms for Sustainable Production</h3>
            <p>Energy optimization in factories requires efficient systems to ensure minimal energy waste while maintaining high production quality.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Selection Sort:</strong> Factories generating a variety of products at different stages of production can use this algorithm to prioritize energy-efficient machines or operations. By reducing non-essential machine usage, Selection Sort helps ensure that operations run on minimal energy consumption while maintaining output quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Brute Force String Search:</strong> In situations where efficiency in material selection or inventory management is necessary, Brute Force String Search can help in identifying patterns in large datasets, such as finding the best types of materials for different production stages that contribute to energy savings.</li>
            </ul>
