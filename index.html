            <h2>Course Introduction</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>What is the course about?</h3>
                <p>The Design and Analysis of Algorithms course helps us understand how to design and evaluate algorithms to tackle problems effectively. We explore key concepts like time and space complexity, which help us measure an algorithm's efficiency. The course also emphasizes how to select the right algorithm for specific scenarios and improve existing ones for better performance.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Studied Data structures and algorithms</h3>
                <p>Throughout this course, we explored a variety of data structures, starting with basics like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, and advancing to more complex ones such as AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, and Segment Trees. On the algorithmic side, we learned techniques like recursion, backtracking, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy methods. We also applied these concepts through algorithms such as Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, KMP string matching, Rabin-Karp, Dijkstra's shortest path, and Prim's minimum spanning tree etc, which gave us hands-on experience in solving different types of problems.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>How do we connect the course with real time applications?</h3>
                <p>Algorithms are everywhere in our daily lives. Search engines use graph algorithms to show relevant results, and online shopping platforms use sorting and searching algorithms to suggest products. Social media relies on pattern-matching algorithms to filter content. Algorithms are also crucial in fields like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and bioinformatics.

By the end of the course, we gain the skills to design efficient algorithms, analyze their performance, and solve real-world problems effectively.
