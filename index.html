    <h2>Data Structures and Algorithms Studied</h2>
    <h3>Math Basics</h3>
    <p>
      - We started by understanding fundamental math concepts, critical for this course. 
      - This included calculating time and space efficiency for solutions and recurrence relations.
      - Examples included solving problems like Tower of Brahma and the n-queens problem.
    </p>

    <h3>Math Foundations</h3>
    <p>
      - We then discussed math foundations, including orders of growth.
      - Using orders of growth, we analyzed the efficiency of solutions in more detail.
    </p>

    <h3>Structured Data Management</h3>
    <p>
      - We explored different data structures for efficient organization and retrieval.
      - We started with n-ary trees, focusing on binary trees.
    </p>

    <p>From binary trees, we learned searching algorithms leading to binary search trees.</p>
    <p>We explored various tree structures like 2-3 trees, AVL trees, and Red-Black trees, each with its strengths in terms of efficiency for insertion and deletion.</p>

    <p>Other structures covered include Tries (efficient for searching based on prefixes), Skip Lists (fast insertion), and Fenwick Trees (efficient point updates and range queries).</p>
    <p>Heaps were introduced for efficient priority queuing, along with their associated algorithms.</p>
    <p>Finally, we learned about Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS), fundamental algorithms for graph traversal.</p>
