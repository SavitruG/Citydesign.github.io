    <!-- Business Case 4: Aryavarta Library System -->
    <section>
        <h2>1. Aryavarta Library</h2>
        <p>This business case aligns with <strong>Target 11.4</strong> of SDG 11, focusing on safeguarding the world’s cultural and natural heritage.</p>

        <p>The Aryavarta Library System aims to preserve and provide easy access to cultural and educational resources, ensuring the city’s heritage is digitally preserved for future generations.</p>
        <p>This system aims to provide simple and fast library access to all educational institutes in Aryavarta</p>

        <h3>Hashing for efficient storage</h3>
        <p>Hashing enables efficient storage and retrieval of book and user data in the library system. By hashing book IDs (e.g., ISBNs), the system ensures fast lookups, making it scalable as the library grows, with constant-time access for data retrieval.</p>
        <a href="hash_code.html" class="btn">View Hashing Code</a>

        <h3>Trie - Autocomplete</h3>
        <p>A Trie enables fast searching by title, author, or keyword, even with partial input. It supports features like autocomplete and efficiently stores book titles by sharing common prefixes, improving search performance and memory usage.</p>
        <a href="trie_code.html" class="btn">View Trie Code</a>

        <h3>Boyer-Moore for searching</h3>
        <p>The Boyer-Moore Algorithm speeds up searches for specific words or phrases within large book contents, improving search efficiency compared to brute-force methods.</p>

        <h3>Rabin-Karp Algorithm: Plagiarism Detection</h3>
        <p>The Rabin-Karp Algorithm detects plagiarism by comparing hashes of substrings in submitted documents with those in the library. This allows quick identification of matching text and ensures academic integrity by detecting duplicate content across large datasets.</p>

    <!-- 2. Medical Facilities -->
    <section>
        <h2>2. Medical Facilities</h2>
        <p>This business case addresses the need for accessible, affordable, and sustainable healthcare facilities in Aryavarta, ensuring all residents have access to quality medical services.</p>
        <p><strong>Target 11.3:</strong> By 2030, increase the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, mitigation, and adaptation to climate change, with a focus on medical infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Improved healthcare facilities contribute to a healthier population, better quality of life, and economic productivity in the city.</p>

        <h3>Efficient Management of Medical Resources</h3>
        <p>Data structures and algorithms play a crucial role in optimizing healthcare delivery and resource allocation in Aryavarta's medical facilities. Here's how:</p>

        <h4>Hash Tables for Patient Data Management</h4>
        <p><strong>Hash Tables</strong> provide an efficient way to manage patient data. With a hash table, patient records can be stored with a unique identifier (such as patient ID) as the key, allowing quick access to their medical history, appointment status, and other relevant information. Hash tables provide fast lookups, insertions, and deletions, ensuring that healthcare providers can quickly retrieve patient details and make informed decisions.</p>

        <h4>Heap Sort for Efficient Resource Prioritization</h4>
        <p><strong>Heap Sort</strong> can be used to prioritize patients based on the severity of their conditions. A max-heap structure can help ensure that the most critical patients are treated first. It optimizes healthcare resources by reducing wait times and improving the overall flow of patients through medical facilities.</p>

        <h4>KMP Algorithm for Gene Sequence Search</h4>
        <p>The <strong>Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm</strong> can be applied in medical facilities to efficiently search for gene sequences in genomic data. For example, KMP can help quickly identify specific patterns or mutations in patient genetic information, aiding in faster diagnoses and personalized treatment plans. By optimizing the search for specific sequences, KMP ensures a quicker response in cases requiring genetic analysis.</p>

    <!-- Business Case 2: Networking (Internet) -->
    <section>
        <h2>3. Efficient Internet access</h2>
        <p>This business case focuses on improving internet connectivity and networking in Aryavarta to ensure all residents have access to affordable and reliable internet services.</p>
        <p><strong>Target 11.1:</strong> By 2030, ensure access for all to safe, affordable housing and basic services, including internet access.</p>
        <p>Better internet connectivity enhances communication, education, and economic opportunities for everyone in the city.</p>

        <h3>Networking and Routing Algorithms</h3>
        <p>Networking algorithms, like Dijkstra's, help route data efficiently. These algorithms find the best paths for data transmission, ensuring fast and reliable communication throughout the city.</p>

        <h3>Identification of nodes: Graphs</h3>
        <p>In networking, a graph can represent the city's infrastructure, with nodes as houses and edges as communication links. Graphs help identify the most efficient paths to connect all residents to the internet.</p>

        <h3>Kruskal's Algorithm for Efficient Network Connection</h3>
        <p>Kruskal’s Algorithm is used to connect all houses in the most cost-effective way. It finds the minimum spanning tree (MST), connecting all nodes with the least cost, avoiding redundant connections.</p>

    <!-- Business Case 1: Transportation -->
<section>
    <h2>4. Transportation</h2>
    <p>This business case aligns with the target 11.2 of SDG 11, focusing on providing safe, affordable, and sustainable transport systems for all.</p>
    <p><strong>Target 11.2:</strong> By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, and sustainable transport systems, improving road safety and expanding public transport, with attention to vulnerable groups such as women, children, persons with disabilities, and older persons.</p>
    <p>The goal is to provide an efficient bus facility to all kinds of people to all the locations in the city of Aryavarta.</p>

    <h3>Arrays as a tool for bus scheduling</h3>
    <p>Arrays store bus schedules, such as departure times, in an organized way. This allows quick access to schedule information, helping both passengers and operators know when the next bus arrives. For example, an array could store all bus departure times.</p>
    <pre>
let busSchedule = ['08:00', '09:00', '10:00', '11:00'];  // Departure times
    </pre>

    <h3>Queues: Ticket allotment</h3>
    <p>Queues manage ticket allotment by following a first-come, first-served order. Passengers join the queue as they arrive, and the first person in line receives their ticket. This ensures fairness when distributing tickets, especially for limited seats.</p>
    <pre>
let ticketQueue = [];
ticketQueue.push("Passenger 1");
ticketQueue.push("Passenger 2");
ticketQueue.push("Passenger 3");
    </pre>

    <h3>Dijkstra's Algorithm: Identification of bus routes</h3>
    <p>Dijkstra's Algorithm helps find the shortest or fastest route between bus stops. It treats the bus network as a graph, where stops are nodes and travel times are edges. The algorithm helps buses take the quickest path, saving time and reducing fuel consumption.</p>
