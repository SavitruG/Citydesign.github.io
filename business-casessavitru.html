    <section>
        <h2>Business Case 1: Transportation</h2>
        <p>This business case aligns with the target 11.2 of SDG 11, focusing on providing safe, affordable, and sustainable transport systems for all.</p>
        <p><strong>Target 11.2:</strong> By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, and sustainable transport systems, improving road safety and expanding public transport, with attention to vulnerable groups such as women, children, persons with disabilities, and older persons.</p>
        <p>The goal is to provide an efficient bus facility to all kinds of people to all the locations in the city of Aryavarta.</p>

        <h3>Dijkstra's Algorithm for identifying bus routes</h3>
        <p>Dijkstra's Algorithm helps find the shortest or fastest route between bus stops. It treats the bus network as a graph, where stops are nodes and travel times are edges. The algorithm helps buses take the quickest path, saving time and reducing fuel consumption.</p>

        <h3>Arrays as a tool for bus scheduling</h3>
        <p>Arrays store bus schedules, such as departure times, in an organized way. This allows quick access to schedule information, helping both passengers and operators know when the next bus arrives. For example, an array could store all bus departure times.</p>
        <pre>
let busSchedule = ['08:00', '09:00', '10:00', '11:00'];  // Departure times
        </pre>

        <h3>Queues for bus ticket allotment</h3>
        <p>Queues manage ticket allotment by following a first-come, first-served order. Passengers join the queue as they arrive, and the first person in line receives their ticket. This ensures fairness when distributing tickets, especially for limited seats.</p>
        <pre>
let ticketQueue = [];
ticketQueue.push("Passenger 1");
ticketQueue.push("Passenger 2");
ticketQueue.push("Passenger 3");
        </pre>

    <h2>Business Case 2: Networking (Internet)</h2>
    <p>This business case focuses on improving internet connectivity and networking in Aryavarta to ensure all residents have access to affordable and reliable internet services.</p>
    <p><strong>Target 11.1:</strong> By 2030, ensure access for all to safe, affordable housing and basic services, including internet access.</p>
    <p>Better internet connectivity enhances communication, education, and economic opportunities for everyone in the city.</p>

    <h3>Networking and Routing Algorithms</h3>
    <p>Networking algorithms, like Dijkstra's, help route data efficiently. These algorithms find the best paths for data transmission, ensuring fast and reliable communication throughout the city.</p>

    <h3>Graphs for Identifying Nodes in the Network</h3>
    <p>In networking, a graph can represent the city's infrastructure, with nodes as houses and edges as communication links. Graphs help identify the most efficient paths to connect all residents to the internet.</p>

    <h3>Kruskal's Algorithm for Efficient Network Connection</h3>
    <p>Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm is used to connect all houses in the most cost-effective way. It finds the minimum spanning tree (MST), connecting all nodes with the least cost, avoiding redundant connections.</p>
