        <h1>Case Study: Optimal Facility Locations in Aryavarta</h1>

        <p>
            This case study focuses on the city of Aryavarta, a newly designed urban area. The goal is to decide the best locations for essential facilities like hospitals and police stations. The placement must ensure accessibility for all residents and enhance the overall quality of life. Several algorithms are used to solve this problem effectively. 
        </p>

        <h2>City Data</h2>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Category</th>
                    <th>Details</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Total Population</td>
                    <td>1.5 million</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Residential Areas</td>
                    <td>45</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Administrative Areas</td>
                    <td>8</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Industrial Areas</td>
                    <td>10</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Average Travel Time</td>
                    <td>15 minutes</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Usage of Algorithms</h2>

        <h3>1. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
            The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to calculate the shortest paths between all areas in Aryavarta. It identifies the central locations that reduce travel time for residents. For example, this algorithm helps decide where hospitals or police stations should be placed so that no area is more than 15 minutes away.
        </p>
        <p>
            By reducing travel time, this algorithm ensures that residents receive faster medical attention and emergency services, improving their safety and well-being.
        </p>

        <h3>2. AVL Tree</h3>
        <p>
            The AVL Tree is a data structure used to store and manage information about areas, such as population density and proximity to other neighborhoods. It keeps data sorted and allows quick access and updates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using an AVL Tree ensures that decisions about facility placement are based on up-to-date and efficiently managed data. This improves decision-making and optimizes resource allocation.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Sorting</h3>
        <p>
            Sorting is used to rank potential facility locations based on factors like population density and centrality. For example, densely populated areas are given higher priority for facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            By ranking locations, sorting ensures that facilities are placed where they are needed the most, reducing overcrowding and enhancing accessibility.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Depth-First Search (DFS)</h3>
        <p>
            DFS is used to check the connectivity of different areas in Aryavarta. It ensures that all neighborhoods are accessible from the selected facility locations.
        </p>
        <p>
            This algorithm guarantees that no area is isolated, improving overall access to essential services.
        </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            After applying these algorithms, the following locations were identified as optimal for facility placement in Aryavarta:
        </p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Facility</th>
                    <th>Locations</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Hospitals</td>
                    <td>Sector 5, Sector 12, Sector 20</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Police Stations</td>
                    <td>Sector 3, Sector 15, Sector 27</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The use of algorithms such as Floyd-Warshall, AVL Trees, sorting, and DFS ensures efficient and equitable placement of facilities in Aryavarta. These methods improve accessibility, reduce response times, and enhance the quality of life for all residents.
