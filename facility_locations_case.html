        <h1>Case Study: Optimal Facility Locations in Urban Cities</h1>

        <p>
            In this case study, we analyze the optimal placement of essential facilities like hospitals and police stations in urban areas.
            Using data from three existing cities—City A, City B, and City C—we propose methods to ensure accessibility for residents.
            The algorithms used to solve this problem include Floyd-Warshall for calculating shortest paths, AVL Trees for managing data efficiently,
            sorting for ranking locations, and Depth-First Search (DFS) for exploring city connectivity.
        </p>

        <h2>City Data</h2>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>City</th>
                    <th>Population</th>
                    <th>Residential Areas</th>
                    <th>Administrative Areas</th>
                    <th>Industrial Areas</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>City A</td>
                    <td>500,000</td>
                    <td>15</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>3</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>City B</td>
                    <td>800,000</td>
                    <td>20</td>
                    <td>8</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>City C</td>
                    <td>1,200,000</td>
                    <td>30</td>
                    <td>10</td>
                    <td>7</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            The goal is to place facilities such that no area in the city is more than 15 minutes away from a hospital or police station.
            Additionally, we aim to minimize the total travel distance between facilities and densely populated areas.
        </p>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <h3>1. Shortest Path Calculation (Floyd-Warshall)</h3>
        <p>
            We use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of areas in the city.
            This helps us identify the central locations that minimize travel distances for all residents.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Efficient Data Management (AVL Tree)</h3>
        <p>
            AVL Trees are used to store and manage information about potential facility locations, such as population density and proximity to other areas.
            This ensures fast retrieval and updating of data during analysis.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Location Ranking (Sorting)</h3>
        <p>
            We sort potential locations based on factors like population density, centrality, and travel time. The top-ranked locations are selected for facility placement.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Connectivity Check (DFS)</h3>
        <p>
            Using DFS, we verify that all areas in the city are connected and accessible from the chosen facility locations.
        </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            After applying these methods, the following locations were identified as optimal for facility placement:
        </p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>City</th>
                    <th>Hospital Locations</th>
                    <th>Police Station Locations</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>City A</td>
                    <td>Area 3, Area 8</td>
                    <td>Area 6, Area 14</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>City B</td>
                    <td>Area 5, Area 12, Area 19</td>
                    <td>Area 4, Area 15</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>City C</td>
                    <td>Area 7, Area 16, Area 23</td>
                    <td>Area 9, Area 18, Area 27</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            By combining graph algorithms with data structures, we can efficiently determine optimal facility locations in urban cities.
            This approach ensures equitable access to essential services while minimizing travel distances for residents.
