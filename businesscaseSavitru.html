        <h2>What are the SDGs and Their Goals?</h2>
        <p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 global objectives established by the United Nations in 2015. These goals aim to address the most pressing challenges facing humanity and the planet, ranging from poverty eradication to climate action.</p>
        <p>The SDGs are designed to be a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030. They cover a broad spectrum of issues and are interconnected, meaning that success in one area often requires progress in others. The goals are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SDG 1:</strong> No Poverty</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 2:</strong> Zero Hunger</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 3:</strong> Good Health and Well-being</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 4:</strong> Quality Education</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 5:</strong> Gender Equality</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 6:</strong> Clean Water and Sanitation</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 7:</strong> Affordable and Clean Energy</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 8:</strong> Decent Work and Economic Growth</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 9:</strong> Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 10:</strong> Reduced Inequalities</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 11:</strong> Sustainable Cities and Communities</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 12:</strong> Responsible Consumption and Production</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 13:</strong> Climate Action</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 14:</strong> Life Below Water</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 15:</strong> Life on Land</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 16:</strong> Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 17:</strong> Partnerships for the Goals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each goal has specific targets and indicators that guide progress. The SDGs are essential in shaping global development agendas and policies, ensuring no one is left behind in the pursuit of a more sustainable world.</p>
        <p>We are focusing on <strong>SDG 11</strong> as our course project aligns with its goals and intentions.</p>

        <h2>SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</h2>
        <p>SDG 11 focuses on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. It aims to ensure access to affordable, safe, and sustainable housing, transportation systems, and green public spaces. Achieving SDG 11 requires addressing urban challenges such as rapid urbanization, pollution, and inadequate infrastructure.</p>
        <p>The goal is to develop cities that are environmentally friendly, offer equitable opportunities for all, and contribute to the well-being of their residents. Efforts to achieve SDG 11 include improving urban planning, enhancing public transportation, and increasing green spaces to reduce pollution and enhance the quality of life in urban areas.</p>
        <p>The following page ponders upon the business cases I have identified and how they are aligned with the <strong>targets</strong> and <strong>indicators</strong> of <strong>SDG 11</strong>.</p>
