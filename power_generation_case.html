        <h1>Business Case: Power Generation and Air Quality</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Power Generation: Renewable Energy in Smart Cities</h2>
            <p><strong>Target 11.2:</strong> By 2030, we aim to provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems. One way to meet this target is through clean energy solutions. Imagine electric vehicles powered by renewable sources like solar and wind. This shift reduces reliance on fossil fuels, thus contributing to cleaner cities and greener transportation.</p>

            <p><strong>Target 11.6:</strong> Another ambitious target is to reduce the environmental impact of cities, especially by improving air quality. To achieve this, cities are transitioning to cleaner energy sources, primarily solar, wind, and hydroelectricity, which reduce harmful emissions compared to conventional power plants.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Power Generation Algorithms: Managing Renewable Energy</h2>
            <h3>1. Renewable Energy Management</h3>
            <p>To effectively distribute energy from renewable sources across urban areas, several algorithms play an essential role in data management, power allocation, and ensuring the grid operates efficiently.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Binary Search Tree (BST):</strong> This algorithm helps manage large sets of data, such as energy demand and production figures, that change over time. It allows us to store and retrieve energy data efficiently, ensuring that resources are allocated based on current demands and availability. For example, BST can help balance energy supply across various parts of the city, optimizing renewable energy distribution.</li>
                <li><strong>Dijkstra’s Algorithm:</strong> Efficient power distribution is critical in a smart city. Dijkstra’s Algorithm finds the most optimal routes to distribute energy from renewable sources like solar farms or wind parks to homes and businesses, minimizing energy loss and optimizing infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>Merge Sort:</strong> Sorting massive datasets quickly is key to managing the real-time influx of energy production and consumption data. Merge Sort ensures that this process happens smoothly, sorting data from renewable energy providers in order of productivity so that grid operators can identify peak-producing systems and adjust supply accordingly.</li>
                <li><strong>Heap Sort:</strong> This algorithm allows power systems to prioritize energy distribution based on urgency. By assigning priorities—like hospitals or critical facilities—Heap Sort helps direct energy where it’s most needed during peak hours or during disruptions, ensuring uninterrupted service for key infrastructure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Air Quality Optimization: Smarter Cities</h3>
            <p>Air quality in urban areas is directly tied to the energy we use and the industries that drive economic growth. As part of improving the environment, smart cities deploy intelligent systems to monitor and optimize air quality across districts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Floyd’s Algorithm:</strong> Air quality sensors are spread out across the city in a network. Floyd’s Algorithm helps determine the most efficient communication paths for these sensors to send real-time air quality data to central systems. It ensures that air pollution data is gathered promptly with minimal network delay, allowing quicker decision-making for pollution control measures.</li>
                <li><strong>DFS and BFS:</strong> To understand the source of pollution or identify areas with the most need for green spaces, algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) come in handy. These graph traversal techniques help cities monitor air quality hotspots by scanning networks of air quality sensors. BFS could find nearby clean air zones, while DFS helps dive deep into industrial zones for more detailed monitoring of pollution levels.</li>
            </ul>
